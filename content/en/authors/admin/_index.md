I'm a lawyer. I use command line editing systems, mainly _Vim_ and _Emacs_, on _LaTeX_ language.

The transition from traditional graphic writing systems has been challenging. But now I fully agree with those who say that text-based systems are enormously more efficient than the corresponding graphics.

Perhaps this is the leitmotif of this non-blog where I publish tips and notes (S&A) on various topics. If someone will find them useful, I will be pleased. That's all.

Browsing the web you may find other resources of mine from which I have taken some of my articles.

- [FP BLOG (in italian)](https://francopasut.blogspot.com/)
- [FP BLOG (in english)](https://francopasut-en.blogspot.com/)
- [My Notebook](https://francopasut.github.io/)
- [Medium](https://medium.com/@FrancoPasut)

I also graduated (today you would say graduated) in Piano and Traditional Composition: on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQatUUJTIhFNKr1dMYx1N7Q) you can find some recordings.
